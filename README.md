# Aki Home

A better version of OreoSearchPage, now in extension form!

Aki Home is a rework of [OreoSearchPage](https://cakephone.github.io/OreoSearchPage/) as a Chrome Extension (for now).

## Why make it an extension?

I've experienced long wait times for OreoSearchPage to load. Making it an extension just makes it work so much better. I not only took the chance to rebrand it, but to also integrate it with the browser, no longer leaving users to manually enter their bookmarks.

## Why Aki?

Aki (あき) is a Japanese name meaning "Clean", "Clear", "Simple", etc. Which is what I was aiming for with it. A simple, customisable and clean home that greets you every time you open your browser.

# Installation

- Clone this repository and move it somewhere safe, that's where the extension will be loaded from.

- Go to `chrome://extensions`.

- Make sure to enable Developer Mode at the top right corner.

- Load Unpacked.

- Locate the folder of the repo and select it.

- Done! Enjoy Aki Home!
